## Implementation in Code

The blog page has been updated to use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading:

```jsx
<Image 
  src={post.image}
  alt={post.imageAlt}
  width={800}
  height={450}
  className="w-full h-full object-cover transition-transform duration-300 hover:scale-105"
/>
```

This provides:
- Automatic image optimization
- Proper sizing and responsive behavior
- Improved loading performance with lazy loading

## Best Practices

1. **Optimize your images** before uploading them to reduce file size
2. **Use descriptive alt text** for accessibility (already implemented in the code)
3. **Maintain consistent style** across all blog images
4. **Consider the content** of each article when selecting images
5. **Respect copyright** - ensure you have proper rights to use all images
